title: Farewell, Discord.
---

Hi there folks, your friendly neighborhood chronically online Discord server owner here!

I've decided to get rid of this Discord account for my own mental health. I had been spending
way too much time on here, and it's well necessary that I take a break and I find myself.

If you want to keep in touch, message me on TikTok: @verbaldiarrhea00. You can also [join my
server, Midnight Wisteria](https://dsc.gg/midnight-wisteria) and find a team member who can
get you in contact me if you don't use TT.

If you join MW, you can find my resignation announcement [here](https://discord.com/channels/1103820049795514388/1256356101452992542/1256651097255448749).

I wish you all the best. I'll be back soon, I promise.

Yours truly,
Estelle.
